About.  About **what**, me?  Or the site?

I guess I'd want to write what the *site* is for, but you want to know about *me*...

I am:
- a technologist forged in the days of 300 baud dialup, 1K RAM, and no persistent storage
- a roleplayer who misses the days of text-based MUSHes
- a SCAdian who wanted to cook, brew and do heraldry and started off doing none of those things (but made my way around to them, eventually)
- a homebrewer who likes brewing styles not easily found locally
- a bass player who should be better but having fun where I am

This site is mostly to keep track of intentions, efforts and, hopefully, successes.
