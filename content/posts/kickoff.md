I've been meaning to do better with sharing projects online along with their status, successes and failures.  Whether it's cooking, coding, playing bass, gaming, writing, whatever...someone might enjoy reading about the journeys, even if it's just me so I know what I'm doing or intending to do, where I left off or where I've accomplished something I set out to do (and how I got there, if I did).

We'll see how it goes.  

I've met me before.  

But, hey..."this time...", right?
